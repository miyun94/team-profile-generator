  ## Description
  This application allows a manager to  generate a webpage that displays the team's basic information. For each member there are certain criteria specific to that role such as github information for the enginner or school information for the intern. This application lets the manager add and generate as many card profiles needed for the number of employees under them.


  ## Installation
  Here are the steps to get the application up and running: 
  Inquirer npm is needed for this project.

  ## Usage
  Once the code is cloned run the application in the terminal. A list of questions should come up starting first with the manager's information and then moving on to asking if the user would like to add an engineer or intern. Keep adding as many employees needed. Once finished, simply select the 'done' option and a HTML page with the user's inputs will be generated.
